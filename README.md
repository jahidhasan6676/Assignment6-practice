# Pet Adoption Platform

## Description
This project is a dynamic web-based pet adoption platform that allows users to explore a variety of pets based on different categories. Users can view detailed information about each pet and initiate the adoption process through a countdown feature. The platform is designed for an engaging user experience, incorporating smooth scrolling, sorting functionality, and a feature for users to mark their favorite pets. Built with modern JavaScript (ES6), it makes real-time API calls to dynamically fetch and display pet data.

## Key Features
1. **Category-Based Pet**: Users can view the cards by clicking on the pets button section.
2. **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking the View More button in the hero section will scroll to the new section.
3. **Responsive Design**: The platform is optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience whether users are on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
4. **Adoption countdown**: When the adopt button is clicked, a modal will show and decrement countdown for 3 seconds.
5. **Favorites Feature**: Users can mark pets they like, with their favorite images displayed in a dedicated section for easy access.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Used for more concise and cleaner function expressions.
- **Template Literals**: Used for writing simple HTML, especially for creating pet cards and modal content.
- **Async/Await**: Simplifies the handling of asynchronous API calls, making the code more manageable.
- **Sorting**: When the Sort by Price button is clicked, the user will see the pets in descending price
- **Promises**:   Integrated for handling asynchronous operations effectively, providing structured error management through `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.
